## What is this?

The Rewrite project is a mass refactoring ecosystem for Java and other source code, designed to eliminate technical debt across an engineering organization. It consists of a platform of prepackaged refactoring recipes for common framework migration and stylistic consistency tasks in Java, ready for you to apply in your build via Maven or Gradle plugins.

## How To Build
Since rewrite interacts with Java compiler internals, this project must be built with a Java 8 JDK.
On more recent JDKs you will run into errors; configuring a more recent JDK to target Java 8 language/bytecode level is not sufficient.

If you, very reasonably, don't want to change your `JAVA_HOME` to point at an old JDK, check out [jenv](https://www.jenv.be/).
On Mac, Linux, and Windows Subsystem for Linux, jenv allows you to configure JDK usage on a per-project basis.
